# Project 10: Higher Lower Game

## Description:
The Higher-Lower Game is a fun and interactive command-line game where players guess which option has more followers 
on social media. The game continues as long as the user guesses correctly, keeping track of their score. It offers a 
simple yet engaging experience, demonstrating core programming concepts like data handling, user interaction, and 
modular design.

## How to Play:
1. Game Objective: Guess which of the two options (A or B) has more followers on social media.
2. Starting the Game: The game will display two options with their details (name, description, and country).
3. Making a Guess: You will be prompted to choose either 'A' or 'B' based on which one you think has more followers.
4. Game Progression: If you guess correctly, you will continue to the next round with a new set of options.
5. Losing the Game: If your guess is wrong, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
6. Replay Option: After the game ends, you can choose to play again or exit.
