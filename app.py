# Project 10: Higher Lower Game
## Description:
The Higher-Lower Game is a fun and interactive command-line game where players guess which option has more followers 
on social media. The game continues as long as the user guesses correctly, keeping track of their score. It offers a 
simple yet engaging experience, demonstrating core programming concepts like data handling, user interaction, and 
modular design.

### Features:
- Random selection of elements for comparison.
- Validation of user input for better user experience.
- Continuous gameplay until the user makes a wrong guess.
- Keeps track of and displays the user's score.
- Option to replay the game after completion.
